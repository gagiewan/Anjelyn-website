            <h2>What is Good Friday?</h2>
            <p>Good Friday marks the day when Jesus Christ was crucified on the cross, as part of God's plan to redeem mankind from sin. According to Christian belief, Jesus' death serves as the ultimate sacrifice for humanity, offering salvation and eternal life to those who believe in Him. The day is observed with church services that focus on Jesus' Passionâ€”His suffering, death, and the significance of His sacrifice. Many Christians also engage in fasting, prayer, and reflection during this time.</p>
