        <h1>Feast of Sacrifice (Eid al-Adha)</h1>

        <p>Eid al-Adha, also known as the Feast of Sacrifice, is one of the most important Islamic holidays. It commemorates the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to God. Before the sacrifice took place, God provided a ram as a substitute.</p>

            <h2>What is Eid al-Adha?</h2>
            <p>Eid al-Adha is a time of prayer, reflection, and charity. Families traditionally perform the **Qurbani** (sacrificial slaughter of an animal) and distribute meat among family, friends, and the less fortunate. It is also a period of communal prayers, festive meals, and acts of generosity.</p>
