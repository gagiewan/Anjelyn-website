            <h2>What is Labour Day?</h2>
            <p>Labour Day is a holiday that honors the achievements of workers and advocates for the rights and better working conditions for employees. The day is celebrated with parades, rallies, and discussions about workers' rights, such as fair wages, the right to form unions, and safe working conditions. The observance of Labour Day can be traced back to labor movements in the late 19th century, particularly in the United States and Europe, where workers fought for an 8-hour workday and better conditions in factories.</p>
