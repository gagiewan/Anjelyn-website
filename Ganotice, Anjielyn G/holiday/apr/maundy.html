            <h2>What is Maundy Thursday?</h2>
            <p>Maundy Thursday, also known as Holy Thursday, is observed on the Thursday before Easter. It commemorates two important events in the Christian faith: the institution of the Holy Eucharist (or Communion) and the washing of the disciples' feet by Jesus. The term "Maundy" comes from the Latin word *mandatum*, meaning "commandment," referring to Jesus' commandment to His disciples to love one another as He has loved them.</p>
