        <h1>Ramadan</h1>

        <p>Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, observed by Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting, prayer, reflection, and community. It is considered one of the Five Pillars of Islam and is a time of spiritual growth, self-discipline, and empathy for those in need.</p>

            <h2>What is Ramadan?</h2>
            <p>Ramadan is a sacred time for Muslims during which they fast from dawn until sunset. Fasting includes abstaining from food, drink, smoking, and sinful behavior. It is a time for increased devotion, prayer, and reading of the Quran. The fast is seen as a way to purify the soul, develop self-control, and increase empathy and compassion for others, particularly the less fortunate.</p>

        <p>In addition to fasting, Muslims engage in nightly prayers known as Taraweeh, attend community events, and give charity to those in need. The month ends with the celebration of Eid al-Fitr, a joyous festival marking the end of fasting and a time of feasting and social gatherings.</p>
