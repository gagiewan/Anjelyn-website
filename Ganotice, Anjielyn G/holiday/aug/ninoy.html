            <h2>Who was Ninoy Aquino?</h2>
            <p>Ninoy Aquino was a staunch critic of authoritarian rule in the Philippines. His unwavering stand against oppression led to his imprisonment and eventual exile. Upon his return to the country on August 21, 1983, he was tragically assassinated, an event that sparked widespread protests and led to the 1986 **People Power Revolution**.</p>
